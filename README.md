# PacMen-Exercise
Description: 
In this assignment for MIT xPRO, I practiced creating multiple "PacMen" on demand and moving the PacMen across the page. The starter HTML code was provided by MIT, and the Script included multiple guidelines and instructions along the way to help me practice setting positions, adding new Child images, loop over PacMen array, detect collision with walls to make PacMen bounce. This demonstrates my first experience with the Document Object Model.

How to run:
Using all files (images/pacman1, images/pacman2, images/pacman3, images/pacman4, index.html, and pacmen.js), one will open the program. Once the button is clicked, more PacMen appear to take over the screen. 

Road-map:
This is already a fun activity to demonstrate random objects interacting with one another and the screen. Perhaps a future programmer could add more elements that could interact with the PacMen in a game-like environment to create an even more engaging program.
